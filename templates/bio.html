        My name is Hoseok (pronounced "Hoh-suhk"), and I'm passionate about making a positive impact through data and
        machine learning. I started my undergraduate degree in 2019 at the University of Waterloo as a Mathematical
        Physics student. My journey into AI and machine learning began during my second year, when I transferred to
        Waterloo's Data Science degree.
        <br>
        <br>
        My research interests include machine learning applications in biomedical research. Throughout my internships,
        I've had the opportunity to work on ML solutions in various interdisciplinary fields, including industrial
        automation, mineral exploration, lung ultrasonography, and research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2022, I interned with Deep Breathe, a research group based in London, Ontario, during which I collaborated on
        the experimental design of assessing the generalization ability of a lung sliding detection model. As of May
        2024, the paper has been published to the <em>MDPI Diagnostics</em> journal; you can read it
        <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/14/11/1081" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy working on projects, often stemming from things I feel would be convenient in my daily
        life. For instance, I'm currently working on a chatbot web app to help students study.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from that, I like playing piano and going to the gym. I've started documenting my gym progress on Instagram
        under the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onepressman/" style="text-decoration:underline;">onepressman</a>
        account. I post a healthy mix of gym lifts and fitness-related memes on there.
